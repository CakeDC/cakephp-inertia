The **Inertia** Plugin allows a CakePHP application to integrate Vue 3 components in the front end without the need to write a specific API for data transfer.

All this by adding a Middleware and view classes that facilitate almost automatically the conversion of objects and data in JSON, as well as the direct load in the components.

The plugin is thought as a base to extend and use your app specific controllers and views from.

That it works out of the box doesn't mean it is thought to be used exactly like it is but to provide you a kick start.
